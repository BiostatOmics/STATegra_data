# STATegra_data

In this repository, we introduce a semi-reduced version of [STATegra](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0202-7) dataset. 

The STATegra dataset contains time-series data for pre-B-cell differentiation in mice, including 6 time points (0h, 2h, 6h, 12h, 18h, 24h). A set of samples has been subject to drug-controlled induction of the Ikaros transcription factor, while the Control cells have not and, therefore, will not differentiate into B-cells.
